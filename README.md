# VA-Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal and professional portfolio that includes various aspects such as my name and a navigation bar which can take you to different sections. These sections include an about me section with an updated picture of myself, my contact information, and my strongest work I have created related to this field.

## Usage
 This portfolio will allow me to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp, and having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
